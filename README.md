# Cell-Analysis
 
### Repo description
This repository contains a `cell analysis script` that is developed in Python and uses color filtering and post processing techniques to identify and analyze cells in images. The script is designed to be used as a standalone tool or as part of a larger image processing pipeline, and is intended for applications such as medical research and biology experiments where accurate and reliable cell analysis is crucial.

The cell analysis script uses color filtering to identify cells in the images, and then applies post processing techniques, such as morphological operations, to remove noise and improve the accuracy of the cell detection. The detected cells are then analyzed using a variety of algorithms, including edge detection and region growing, to extract detailed information about their shape, size, and other properties.

The repository includes a detailed documentation that explains how to use the cell analysis script, as well as a set of sample images and results that show the performance of the script on different types of cells.

Overall, this repository is a valuable resource for anyone interested in developing tools for cell analysis and working with images in Python. The cell analysis script provides a simple and effective way to identify and analyze cells in images, and can be easily integrated into existing image processing pipelines.
